PyCI provides a set of opinionated CI related operations, specifically built for Python projects.

## Why should I use it?

What if I were to tell you, that you could, **automatically**:

- Turn your CLI into self-contained, python embedded, binary executables (Linux, Mac and Windows - As well as a 
graphical windows installer).
- Create GitHub releases with a pretty changelog and automatic version bumps
- Upload wheels to PyPI

Would that be something you might be interested in?

If your answer is yes, or if you just got the reference, carry on ðŸ˜Ž

PyCI integrates with your existing CI providers and enables continuous release of 
the project. All you have to do is invoke the command at the end of your CI workflow. Once you run the command `pyci
 release`, it will detect the CI provider and perform a release of the associated commit.
 
 **Currently only supported for projects hosted on Github and running CI on either 
 [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/), [Circle](https://circleci.com/), 
 or [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/)**

Once the command completes, navigate to the release on GitHub. You should see something like this:

### Packaging

#### Wheel

#### Binary

#### NSIS 

## Installation

```bash
pip install py-ci
```

Or, since PyCI itself uses PyCI for releases, you can simply download the executable from the [releases](https://github.com/iliapolo/pyci/releases) page.


### Credentials

There are several credentials used by PyCI. All credentials are passed via environment variables,
never via the command line. All credentials can be prompted interactively in case the appropriate
env variable is not defined.

Every supported CI provider has a way of securely injecting environment variables to a job.

#### GitHub

PyCI uses a [Github Authentication Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for authentication. 
It is passed via the `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` env variable.

You must create the token with the necessary scopes for full control over your repository.

#### PyPI

PyCI needs your PyPI account credentials in order to upload wheels to PyPI. These credentials are:

- `TWINE_USERNAME`
- `TWINE_PASSWORD`


## Not planning to use PyCI?

No hard feelings, but I would really love to know why :)

- Are you missing a feature?
- Does it not fit with your project workflow?

If you could spare a minute or two to simply explain your choice as a comment in 
[this](https://github.com/iliapolo/pyci/issues/30) issue, that would be great, if not, that's ok 
too.
