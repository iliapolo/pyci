Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n+      License.
